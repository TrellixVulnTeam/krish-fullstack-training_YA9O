To auto create a db using hibernate the Spring Boot looks for 2 different files in the classpath 
this script will be automatically run when the server is started
schema.sql or data.sql

This can also be done based on the profile.(you have to set which profile it is that you are in, on the property file in this case) For example
schema-prod.sql
schema-dev.sql
schema-qa.sql

If you create a file inside the resource directory of a maven project, it is considered in the classpath
