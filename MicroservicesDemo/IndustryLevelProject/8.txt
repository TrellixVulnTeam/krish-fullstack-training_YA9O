whenever you register an application on the oauth2 server, the app will be provided with a client-id secret

since no context path is given, the request path wouldn just be /oauth 

The auth token request 
POST request  - localhost:8282/oauth/token
*add 'Basic Auth' 
username as <client-id> 
password as <pin>
*add body (form URL encoded)
grant_type as password
username as authun
password as authpw
scope as READ (if you want to select the scope you want)(or else you will get all what is given from the server)

you'll get the token and a refresh token
as long as the same credentials is sent, the same expiration timer will run (deducting time till the hour is passed)

how can we validate this token? (check token request)
localhost:8282/oauth/check_token?token<token>
 
however, for this to work (without being forbidden) the properties file should have the 
security.oauth2.authorization.check-token-access: permitAll

permitAll - means anyone(with or without un and pw) can access the resource of validating the token 

once the UserConfiguration file is added the .yml file configurations can be removed. 
Added below are what was deleted from it.
spring:
  security:
    user:
      name: authun
      password: authpw
      roles: ADMIN,USER
security:
  oauth2:
    client:
      client-id: mobile 
      client-secret: pin
      access-token-validity-seconds: 3600
      authorized-grant-types: refresh_token,authorization_code,password,client_credentials
      scope: READ,WRITE
    authorization:
      check-token-access: permitAll


Now to retrieve the token as a user
POST request  - localhost:8282/oauth/token
*add 'Basic Auth' 
username as <client-id> 
password as <pin>
