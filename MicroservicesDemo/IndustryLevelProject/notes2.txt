Asynchronous services
Help reduce dependencies between services
Helps reduce blocking calls that increase the latency and high throughput
It is an event driven model
Can avoid cascading failures due to thread /resource blocking/blocking
Eg: severless-computing (AWS lambda) - helps deploye functions rather than services


Asynchronous behaviours for services
SOAP services were replaced by REST sevices
REST services were made to be asynchronous
However, using http (which is a synchronous protocol) makes it hard to achieve this.
So systems usually implement alongside a messaging platform (Eg:  JMS - Java)
The typical behaviour of a a messaging platform includes one end publishing to the server and the other end listening to the server.

The project implements how this is done with Java
After all the coding use,
mvn clean install

java -jar target/<artifact-name>-<version>.jar 1234556

java -jar target/rent-process-task-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 1234556 
gives valid driving license
