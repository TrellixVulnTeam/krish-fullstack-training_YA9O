How to make the profile service secure? (by making the profile server as a resource server)
How do we make only the authorized people call this service? by making the resource server expecting a token from the client to access its resource

Adding just the dependencies is enough to impose authorized access on a particular service
The "generated password" (seen on the console while the server is started) can be used to access (as a basic authorization password) the service for development purposes

If the response is as below,
    "error": "unauthorized",
    "error_description": "Full authentication is required to access this resource"
you should mention on the properties file, where the service can validate the token using,
security:
  oauth2:
    resource:
      token-info-uri: http://localhost:9191/oauth/check_token
    client:
      client-id: mobile 
      client-secret: pin

To send the request with proper authorization,
GET, http://localhost:8191/services/profiles
In the header, 
Header - Authorization 
Value - bearer <token>


how can we limit the access according to the role based permissions

typically, role is assigned in a hierarchy (as admins don't perform any business operations)
admin->...user

and authority can be different
Eg: CEO-> directors -> executives->managers->operators

So we can set permission based on either of these
1) authority
2) role ->in this case each user must have a role
3) or we can use both together like in this project too
